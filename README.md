# ArtemisFinancial

Artemis Financial is a consulting company that specializes in providing personalized individualized financial plans. They want to change their operations by modernizing it to enhance the security of their public web interface. Artemis has requested that we implement a verification step when they add a file as a checksum, which will ensure secure communication during file transfers.
	During the vulnerability assessment, I conducted a thorough analysis of the software used by Artemis Financials. This helped me identify potential security vulnerabilities. One crucial aspect was the implementation of secure coding protocols, which ensured that the software was resilient to common attack vectors. It is important to implement secure coding practices to protect sensitive data, maintain the integrity of systems, and preserve clients' trust. Security vulnerabilities can lead to financial losses, legal consequences, and damage to a company's reputation. Therefore, it is essential to address these issues proactively to contribute to the overall well-being of the company, its clients, and the community.
	I completed a vulnerability assessment, which proved to be challenging due to the need to accurately identify all potential security risks. I collaborated with Artemis Financial to tailor the assessment to their specific needs, resulting in a more effective process. To improve security, I implemented a file verification step using checksums and focused on secure communication mechanisms to protect client data during transfers. I also regularly ran the project to assess security vulnerabilities and conducted penetration testing as part of my strategy. Going forward, I recommend incorporating both static and dynamic security testing to evaluate application security comprehensively. 
To demonstrate my achievements to future employers, I plan to showcase completed assignments that highlight successful integrations of secure communications, particularly the implementation of a file verification step. I believe this would showcase my skills in vulnerability assessment, secure coding, and ability to deliver quality products.
